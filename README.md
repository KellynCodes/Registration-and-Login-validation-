# Registration-and-Login-validation

In this project only the registered users can access the full page of this web app. Non registered members can only access the index page where they will see login and register button at the top right corner of the page, which onclick of any the button  will redirect the user to the login or registration page.
in the registration part the new user can not login with already existing email address in the database.
when the whole form is filled properly and all the conditions attached are fufilled, the user will be redirected to the full site ortherwise warning message will pop-up telling the user to make sure all the details are corectly spelled. 
At the full page we also have a logout button which onclick will destroy the fullpage session and the user will be mandated to login again before accessing the full web app.
